## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
**PANDA** (**Phased Anomaly Diffusion with Progressive Mask Alignment**) is a novel **anomaly synthesis framework** designed for **anomaly segmentation** tasks. It overcomes key limitations of existing Anomaly Synthesis (AS) methods by generating **high-fidelity, well-aligned, and fine-grained** synthetic anomalies, significantly enhancing anomaly segmentation performance.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Challenges in Anomaly Synthesis:
- **Lack of fine-grained texture** â€“ Existing methods struggle to generate realistic anomaly textures.
- **Poor pixel alignment** â€“ Many generative methods fail to properly align synthetic anomalies with the background.
- **Ignoring small anomalies** â€“ Small, fine-grained anomalies are often overlooked during synthesis.

### âœ… How PANDA Solves These Problems:
1. **Phased Diffusion Sampling:** Injects real background information into the denoising process, ensuring realistic texture synthesis.
2. **Progressive Mask Alignment (PMA):** Smooths anomaly-background transitions, preventing misalignment artifacts.
3. **Dual-Branch Anomaly Synthesis:** Ensures small anomalies are effectively generated by integrating a dedicated **anomaly-only branch**.

PANDA achieves **state-of-the-art** (SOTA) performance on **MVTec-AD** and **BTAD** datasets, surpassing existing AS methods.
